# The DisneyBound Store

This website was created as an assigment for class in college. It is a simple website with a lot of errors and mistakes made along the way, as it was the first web project I ever coded.

It uses the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is not the final version that was submited for the assignment as I have lost the files to the actually finished project.

## The purpose of this project

The purpose was to play around and learn in practice how to create websites with just HTML, CSS and simple JavaScript. It was good practice especially for inexperienced students and newbies.
